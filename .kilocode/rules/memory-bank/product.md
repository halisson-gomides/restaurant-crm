# Restaurant CRM - Product Definition

## Why This Project Exists
Restaurant businesses face significant operational challenges that traditional generic CRMs cannot adequately address. Restaurant chains need specialized tools for inventory management, supplier coordination, multi-location operations, and integrated point-of-sale systems that work together seamlessly.

## Problems It Solves

### Operational Challenges
- **Fragmented Systems**: Restaurants typically use separate systems for inventory, POS, suppliers, and customer management
- **Manual Process Overhead**: Shopping lists managed manually, leading to errors and inefficiencies
- **Inventory Visibility**: Lack of real-time inventory tracking across multiple locations
- **Supplier Coordination**: No centralized system for managing supplier relationships and price comparisons
- **Multi-location Complexity**: Difficulty managing operations across multiple restaurant locations
- **Financial Management**: Complex subscription billing and payment processing for B2B services

### Business Impact
- **Cost Reduction**: Automated shopping list generation and price comparison reduces procurement costs
- **Efficiency Gains**: Integrated systems reduce manual work and administrative overhead
- **Better Decision Making**: Real-time analytics and predictive insights for business optimization
- **Scalability**: System designed to support restaurant chain growth across multiple locations

## How It Should Work

### Core User Journey
1. **Restaurant Registration**: Corporate customers (restaurants) register with CNPJ/company details
2. **Multi-role Access**: Different user types (administrator, manager, employee, shopper, customer) access appropriate features
3. **Shopping List Creation**: Managers create organized shopping lists by categories (proteins, produce, dairy, etc.)
4. **Shopper Interface**: Shoppers receive categorized lists, can compare prices at different supermarkets, and mark items as purchased
5. **Inventory Integration**: Purchased items automatically update inventory levels
6. **Sales Operations**: Staff process orders through integrated POS system
7. **Analytics & Reporting**: Management accesses dashboards and reports for business insights
8. **Predictive Planning**: AI-powered recommendations for inventory and purchasing decisions

### Key User Experience Goals
- **Intuitive Interface**: Clean, elegant design suitable for restaurant staff with varying technical expertise
- **Mobile Responsive**: Shopper interface works well on mobile devices for in-store use
- **Real-time Updates**: Instant synchronization across all system components
- **Role-based Customization**: Each user type sees only relevant features and data
- **Offline Resilience**: Critical functions work even with intermittent connectivity

## User Experience Goals
- **Efficiency**: Reduce time spent on administrative tasks by 50%+
- **Accuracy**: Minimize inventory discrepancies and procurement errors
- **Cost Control**: Enable better price comparison and supplier management
- **Scalability**: Support growth from single location to multi-location chains
- **Data-driven Decisions**: Provide actionable insights for business optimization
